## Inspiration
We love sharks, so we made our portfolio shark themed! The inspiration for the formatting came from some open source bootstrap templates, as well as perusing other folks portfolios online!

## What it does
The website hosts the portfolios of our three-member team. It has a dynamic navigation bar to allow easy switching between web pages, and buttons which scroll to specific sections within our portfolios so you can quickly find relevant information. 

## How we built it
We used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the front-end, and Flask and Jinja on the backend. 

## Challenges we ran into
The main challenge was our lack of familiarity with some of the technology we used. Most of our challenges were due to CSS and Flask issues. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Having a functional site, having custom branding, using clean code practices

## What we learned
We learned a lot about HTML and CSS, as well as how to use Flask and Jinja on the backend. None of us were familiar with Flask or Jinja, so we learned a lot about backend programming during this project. 

## What's next for Shiny Sharks Portfolio
More consistent branding between the home page and portfolio pages, fixing the formatting up

Built with: 
Flask, Python, HTML, CSS, Jinja
